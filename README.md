# CUConfessionBot
Here's the deal. I don't really use Facebook that much any more. The only reason for me to log on is to read Columbia Confessions. Each time I do however, I get sucked into scrolling a feed I don't want to scroll.  
  
I do like Twitter though. I made this bot that reposts Columbia Confessions onto Twitter, so that I can easily read them in my Twitter feed. If you too have this problem, I suggest you follow [@CUConfessionBot](https://twitter.com/CUConfessionBot) on Twitter.  

## Installing
  
If for some odd reason you want to deploy this bot locally, follow the steps below:  
  
1. Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/matteosandrin/CUConfessionBot`
2. Create a [Twitter app](https://developer.twitter.com/) (this might take a few days to get approved)
3. Fill in the Twitter API credentials in the `.env` file
4. Install dependencies with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run `python3 bot.py`
